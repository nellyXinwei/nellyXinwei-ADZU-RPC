>>Customisable Discord Rich Presence for Ateneo de Zoom University (ADZU) Students. Currently able to display ADZU Logo, Edit Details and State of Activity with either Preset Data, or custom-set by the user of the RPC-App. This app is still a console app to be run on command line / Terminal CLI, and it is still on its very early release. Lots of future developments and features have yet to come.

## Some Notes When Trying it out!
### Instructions:
>Git clone repo and cd to the repo on terminal
>Run "python3 main.py on cli"

### Updates:
>CLI app with options to customise text displayed on ur rich presences
>Plan: Turn this to desktop util app with electron framework + database (for now preset datas are in the file mismo hehe)

Will solve bugs and add more features soon hehe, if yall have issues, pls tell me when yall try the app :smile: 

### Problems:
>Sockets stuff get interrupted so rpc gets disconnected sometimes
>Might not work on windows tho added conditions when windows or unix os, i dont have windows :<<
>Still in Early development so use the master branch ig when u try it out

This just random fun app lang im just trying to make hehe. thx
