Customisable Discord Rich Presence for Ateneo de Zoom University (ADZU) Students. Currently able to display ADZU Logo, Edit Details and State of Activity with either Preset Data, or custom-set by the user of the RPC-App. This app is still a console app to be run on command line / Terminal CLI, and it is still on its very early release. Lots of future developments and features have yet to come.
